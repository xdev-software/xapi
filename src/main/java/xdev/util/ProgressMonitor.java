/**
 * The <code>ProgressMonitor</code> interface is implemented by objects that
 * monitor the progress of an activity; the methods in this interface are
 * invoked by code that performs the activity.
 * <p>
 * All activity is broken down into a linear sequence of tasks against which
 * progress is reported. When a task begins, a {@link #beginTask(String, int)}
 * notification is reported, followed by any number and mixture of progress
 * reports ({@link #worked(int)}). When the task is eventually completed, a
 * {@link #done()} notification is reported.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A request to cancel an operation can be signaled using the {@link #cancel()}
 * method. Operations taking a progress monitor are expected to poll the monitor
 * (using {@link #isCanceled()}) periodically and abort at their earliest
 * convenience. Operation can however choose to ignore cancelation requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since notification is synchronous with the activity itself, the listener
 * should provide a fast and robust implementation. If the handling of
 * notifications would involve blocking operations, or operations which might
 * throw uncaught exceptions, the notifications should be queued, and the actual
 * processing deferred (or perhaps delegated to a separate thread).
 * </p>

 * @since 3.0
