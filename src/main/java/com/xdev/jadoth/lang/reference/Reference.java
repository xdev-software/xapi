 * Simple Reference class to handle mutable references. Handle with care!
 * <p>
 * Note: In most cases, a mutable reference object like this should not be neccessary if the program is well
 * structured (that's why no such class exists in the Java API). 
 * Extensive use of this class where it would be better to restructure the program may end in even more structural 
 * problems.<br>
 * Yet in some cases, a mutable reference really is needed or at least helps in creating cleaner structures.<br>
 * So again, use wisely.
