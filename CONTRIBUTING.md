## Releasing [![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/xdev-software/xdev-swing-framework-template/release.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/xdev-software/xdev-swing-framework-template/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Before releasing:
* Consider doing a [test-deployment](https://github.com/xdev-software/xdev-swing-framework-template/actions/workflows/test-deploy.yml?query=branch%3Adevelop) before actually releasing.
* Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

If the ``develop`` is ready for release, create a pull request to the ``master``-Branch and merge the changes.

When the release is finished do the following:
* Merge the auto-generated PR (with the incremented version number) back into the ``develop``
